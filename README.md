# ANA067_MK-urine-clustering-analysis

**Purpose**:  
The purpose of this analysis is to identify patterns and clusters in urine metabolite data collected from multiple samples. This clustering analysis aims to uncover potential biomarkers and groupings that may correlate with specific conditions or treatments.

**Data produced:**  
- Preprocessed metabolite data (normalized and scaled).  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots for dimensionality reduction.  
- Pairplots with correlation heatmaps and regression analyses.  

**Analysis methods:**  
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and scaling.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Pairplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.  
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA to visualize variance across samples.  
- Statistical analysis: Pearson correlation and p-value calculations for feature relationships.
